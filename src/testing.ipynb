      "In the past few years I've done fine with Philips disks, Sony Disks, and Memorex Disks, and even Staples Generic disks gave us no issues, but we recently started using Verbatim DL disks, based on Verbatim's legendary reputation for being the only brand that works in high end, high speed burners.  We had no issues with the DL disks, so when it was time to buy some lower res DVD-Rs, we went with Verbatim.  Well, in 20 years of CD/DVD burning, I've never seen anything like this.\n",
      "\n",
      "First, the ones we got didn't look like the picture.  They had a fancy 3 layer pattern on top to make them like an old fashioned movie reel. (This is their new DigitalMovie line.)  It looked cool, but provided almost no space to label it. But now the real problem - only two out of 25 disks worked, even trying on 2 computers.  That's a 92% failure rate!!!  To put this in perspective, I think the worst I've ever experienced before was maybe 3 bad disks in a 25 pack, with 1 being more typical.  And we can't even return them, since some of them we used.\n",
      "\n",
      "But now we know the truth.  The name \"Verbatim\" is NOT a silver bullet.  At the very least, stay away from their \"DigitalMovie\" brand.\n",
      "It's funny - I'm used to seeing 1 star reviews for people geting a bad hard drive, but a bad set of DVD-R disks?  Come on, Verbatim. :)\n",
